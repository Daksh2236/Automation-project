27. Yes the same patterns emerge

28. It assigns the specified int value to each element of the specified array of instance

29. Yes, the patterns are deterministic

31. We created a new array because with out it, it will cause an interferance in the calculation
    If we don't make a new array we won't be able to keep track of the left so it messes up the calculation 
    
32. In my opinion i feel like my way is better because to me it is much more simpler to make a new variable and make it hold the last one

35. There isn't an infinite amount of possibilities because there are only so many combinations possible for the values left/right/center either being a 0 or  1
